# Kraken üîêüï∏Ô∏è
*A Privacy-Preserving Search Engine for the Monetization of Private Data*

---

## üöÄ Overview

**Kraken** is a decentralized search engine designed to empower users to **monetize their private data**. Unlike conventional engines, Kraken ensures user data is **never exposed in plaintext** through the use of **homomorphic encryption (HE)**, allowing encrypted data to be queried and monetized without compromising privacy or intellectual property.

The project follows a **phased development approach**:

- **Phase 1**: Build a fully functional **plaintext search engine MVP**.
- **Phase 2**: Integrate **homomorphic encryption** using libraries like **Microsoft SEAL** or **Zama's Concrete** to enable secure, privacy-preserving operations.

## üîß Architecture: Phase 1 (Plaintext MVP)

The initial implementation of Kraken is a classical search engine architecture, optimized for modularity and eventual encryption.

### Core Components

| Component              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Link Provider**      | Supplies seed URLs to the crawler |
| **Crawler**            | Orchestrates link fetching, filtering, and content extraction |
| **Link Filter**        | Deduplicates and filters irrelevant URLs |
| **Link Fetcher**       | Fetches page content over HTTP |
| **Content Extractor**  | Parses HTML and extracts textual data |
| **Link Extractor**     | Harvests outbound links for further crawling |
| **Link Graph**         | Maintains a directed graph of URLs and their relations |
| **Content Indexer**    | Indexes content for efficient search |
| **PageRank Calculator**| Computes relative link importance |
| **Metrics Store**      | Tracks operational metrics |
| **Front-end**          | UI for performing searches and submitting links |

## üß™ Roadmap: Phase 2 (Encrypted Search Engine)

In the second version, Kraken will integrate **homomorphic encryption** to ensure complete **data privacy and security**. All computations ‚Äî from indexing to search ‚Äî will occur over encrypted data, ensuring:

- Encrypted user-submitted data and search queries
- Computations on encrypted data without needing decryption
- End-to-end protection of intellectual property
- Monetization via data-access agreements tied to encryption keys

### üîê Planned Cryptographic Toolkits

- [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL) (CKKS/BFV)
- [Zama Concrete](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete) (FHE for Rust)
- Not yet decided: Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) modules for usage auditing
